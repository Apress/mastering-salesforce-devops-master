On **page 295** Point to the original Domain Builder URL:
 
Footnote 20, pointing to the Apex Domain Builder, should point to the original Domain Builder repository: **https://github.com/rsoesemann/apex-domainbuilder**

On **page 301** Failed to credit Robert Sösemann as the author of Domain Builder:

This section should read:
"A new open source framework called the Apex Domain Builder (**https://github.com/rsoesemann/apex-domainbuilder**) offers a very performant and readable way of creating test data. **This module was originally created by Robert Sösemann, also the author of most of the Apex rules for PMD, and a leader in promoting clean coding practices for Salesforce.**"
